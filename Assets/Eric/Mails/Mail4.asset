  EmailTitle: Digital Storage System Updates

  EmailContent: "Good evening Atlas.\n\tThe discussion we had last week, about recreating
    the digital storage system, I just talked about with several of my scientist
    friends to analyze the availability of your new thoughts.\n\tWe did several rounds
    of tests and calculations and we believed what you said was totally workable.
    The only problem is how long we can finish it. The reconstruction will require
    all the powers we have currently and it will make at least area 1, 2, and 3 power
    out. We don\u2019t know the outcome of this action and we are still trying to
    find if there\u2019s another way. But I\u2019m afraid we will have no luck.\n\tWe
    can discuss it more during next week\u2019s navigator meeting. \n\nAll the best,\n\tBryan.\n\u2014------------------------\nUnited
