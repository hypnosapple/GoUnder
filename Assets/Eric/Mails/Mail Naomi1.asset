  EmailContent: "Good morning Atlas, \r\n\r\nRemember the person called TED PARKER
    that we were investigating for the last two months? We developed an Information
    System for all your investigators to use in order to check more detailed information
    to help improve your process of investigation. Currently, we have uploaded as
    much missing people\u2019s information as we could, and we will keep uploading
    when new cases come up. \r\n\r\nWe want you to have a try on the Information
    System and get detailed information about TED PARKER. Plus, remember the new
    Missing People Files I shipped to you several days ago? They contained all the
    information you need to enter for the Information System. Don\u2019t forget to
    read them carefully. Some information on the file might not be fully updated,
    which you need to interpret by yourself. \r\n\r\nGood luck,\r\nNoami Clark \r\n"
