  EmailContent: "Greeting, \r\n\r\nThe commander of Departent F, Alenky Shiro, were
    missing during a mission while they were sailing in area 7 to an island in South.
    Currently, we developed an Information System for all your investigators to use
    in order to check more detailed informations. Also, it will give you a single-use
    communication access code, which can be used for Communication System. The good
    thing of this new coding system is that your signals can be sent to all the islands
    in all areas in a short time. Please have a try on it. \r\n\r\nPlus, remember
    the new Missing People Files I shipped to you several days ago? They contained
    all the information you need to enter for the Information System. Don\u2019t
    forget to read them carefully. Some information on the file might not be fully
    updated, which you need to interpret by yourself. \r\n\r\nGood luck,\r\nNoami
    Clark \r\n"
