  EmailContent: "Hi Atlas, \r\n\r\nWe now developed a new system called, COMMUNICATION
    SYSTEM, ready for all investigators to send signals to all islands in all areas
    now. You can gain the communication code after you complete the form in the Information
    System. Once you know which Island you want to reach out to, you can check the
    Island code on the ISLAND-CODE-LIST. After you gather both codes, you are good
    to go. \r\n\n\nHave a great day,\r\nRingo White \r\n"
