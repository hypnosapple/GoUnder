  EmailContent: "Good morning, Atlas.\n\tLong story short, we need your help. \n\tAround
    a month ago, we received several reports of missing people from different areas.
    We immediately sent people to search, but sadly we couldn\u2019t find anyone.
    All of them just disappeared without any warning. Nothing was stolen or broken
    on their floating island. More detailed, nothing is moved. \n\tSeveral days ago,
    we received a report of missing people from your area. Unfortunately, we don\u2019t
    have any spare investigator at this current moment so we want to assign this
    job to you. It will be easier for you to reach their floating island anyway.
    Detailed information is followed.\n\tPlease let me know if you need any help.
    I will do my best to assist you. Thank you for your cooperation.\n\t\nAll the
    best,\n\tBryan.\n\u2014------------------------\nUnited Maritime Association."
