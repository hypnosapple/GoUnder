  EmailContent: "Hi Atlas, \r\n\r\nWe now developed a new system called, Communication
    System, ready for all investigators to send signals to all islands in all areas
    now. We recommend you to keep the system outside for gather the best signal at
    all time. You can gain the communication code after you complete the form in
    Information System. Once you know which Island you want to reach out to, you
    can check the Island code on the Island Code List. After you gather both codes,
    you can send signal to the certain Island and reach out to people over there
    in order to gather more information about the missing people. \r\n\r\nHave a
    great day,\r\nRingo Shiro \r\n"
