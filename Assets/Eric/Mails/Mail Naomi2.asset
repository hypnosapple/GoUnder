  EmailContent: "Greeting, \r\n\r\nDid you see the email that Ringo sent you about
    the Communication System? Now due to the unknown reason, the system in our headquarters
    is not working properly. We want you to put your other cases on hold and start
    to work on the information of ALENKY WHITE, she was missing during a mission
    while she was sailing in area 7 to an island in the South. Since the missing
    cases start to occur inside our departments, we want you to start your investigation
    as soon as possible. \r\n\r\nWhen you complete the Information Page, get the
    communication code, and send a signal to Alenky\u2019s missing island to see
    if any one responds and give you more clues on this missing event. \r\n\r\nCounting
    on you,\r\nNoami Clark \r\n"
