  - "I\u2019ve just finished work and I\u2019m on my way back home, but something
    doesn\u2019t feel right. I think they\u2019re hiding something from us. The higher
    ups forced us to leave for some...  \u2018important meeting\u2019?"
  - "But I have no idea of what they\u2019re planning, I have a bad feeling about
    this. Please call me back as soon as possible, alright? We might need to move
    to a safer place. I love you."
