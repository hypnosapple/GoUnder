    family. Same as your wife and daughter, more and more people were reported missing
    on the sea for unknown reasons."
  - We really need your help at this point, Atlas.
  - "Remember the case of a missing person called Ted? UMA recently found Ted\u2019s
    disappearance might be related to your family\u2019s and other people\u2019s
    as well. People from UMA are developing some new systems which can help you investigators
    with inquiries."

    due to more people missing and never being found. Our investigation might be
    the last hope. Let me know if you got anything. See you.
