  - You finally wake up my friend.
  - "I\u2019ve called you several times this morning but your phone was off. You
    were doing the research last night right? Just make sure to take some rest friend.I
    don\u2019t want to see you down."
  - But anyway. I need your help.
  - Several days ago, we received a missing person report, Alenky Shiro, one of our
    commanders. She lives in your area and is fairly close to your place, however,
    she was missing suddenly while doing a mission in area 7.
  - I want you to do me a favor. Can you please help us find out the reason for her
    missing?
  - "You should check it in your terminal. Everything related will be there. It\u2019s
    not far away and\u2026to be honest we didn\u2019t expect much to be found. So
    don\u2019t be nervous."
